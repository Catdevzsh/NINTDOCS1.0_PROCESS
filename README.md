## Overview

This project aims to restore and emulate the legendary but elusive Nintendo Ultra Simulator (UltraSim), an early Nintendo 64 emulator developed by Silicon Graphics in 1995. Our goal is to recreate the functionality of UltraSim, leveraging insights from the Oman Archive and implementing simulators such as the algorithm simulator, I/O simulator, co-simulation, reality display processor simulator, and the reality signal processor simulator.

## Features

- **Emulation Accuracy**: Aims to achieve bit-accuracy and clock-accuracy as described in the Oman Archive.
- **Simulator Integration**: Incorporates multiple subsystem simulators to closely mimic the original UltraSim environment.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Built to run on modern systems with adaptations for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
